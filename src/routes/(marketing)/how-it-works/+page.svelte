			Our credit card picking technology simplifies the process of choosing the right credit card
			for you. We use Plaid to access your banking transactions without having to store or see your
			actual username and password. Once we have access to your transactions, we normalize them.
			This means that we adjust the data to ensure accuracy, as different banks will categorize
			transactions differently. We then use our own proprietary algorithm to assign a value to each
			of your transactions in order to properly assess which card is the best fit for you. Once
			weâ€™ve determined the right card for you, we provide referral links to the banks so that we can
			get paid when you sign up. We never sell your data, and it is never shared with any
			third-party companies. Our technology makes the process of finding the right credit card for
			your lifestyle and spending habits simple. We use the most up-to-date technology to analyze
			your transaction data and provide you with the best card for you every time.
